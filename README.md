# hello-world
My first repository.

I'm trying to gain some experience with Git so I can work on more advanced projects. I don't want the inhibition of not knowing how to operate Git.
I enjoy working with Android and Windows OS. I'm hoping to learn more than just how to build Android, as I know now.
I listen to a lot of old music, primarily ELO and The Beatles.

Cheers if you found this repository.
